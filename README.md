# markdown2html

This is a small Go program that takes in markdown file as an argument and produces a matching HTML file.
It was written under a time contraint so the features included are limited in scope. 
The code works such that it would input markdown liket he following:

```
# Header one

Hello there

How are you?
What's going on?

## Another Header

This is a paragraph [with an inline link](http://google.com). Neat, eh?

## This is a header [with a link](http://yahoo.com)
```
and produce HTML that looks like the following:

```
<h1>Header one</h1>

<p>Hello there</p>

<p>How are you?
What's going on?</p>

<h2>Another Header</h2>

<p>This is a paragraph <a href="http://google.com">with an inline link</a>. Neat, eh?</p>

<h2>This is a header <a href="http://yahoo.com">with a link</a></h2>
```
